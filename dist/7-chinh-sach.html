                        We stand behind our mattresses and offer a 10-Year Limited Warranty to prove it. The terms of the Warranty are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your new Tuft & Needle mattress (hereinafter the “mattress” or “Product”) is covered by a 10-year limited warranty (the “Warranty”), which gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights, but those vary from state to state. This Warranty is
                        not transferable and covers you only if you (a) are the original purchaser and current owner of the Tuft & Needle mattress (the “Product”) for which you are seeking recourse under the Warranty and (b) purchased it directly from
                        an authorized Tuft & Needle distribution channel – namely, the website at TN.COM (including purchases made while visiting a Tuft & Needle showroom), Amazon.com, and Huckberry.com. The Limited Warranty thus only applies during the
                        period in which the mattress is owned and controlled by the original purchaser of that mattress. PLEASE RETAIN YOUR PURCHASE RECEIPT SO THAT YOU CAN PRESENT IT TO US IF NECESSARY.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, because we cannot handle international shipping and logistics expenses, your mattress must be in the United States at the time you wish to take advantage of the Warranty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Warranty is limited to material defects resulting from defective materials or workmanship in the Product you have purchased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, this Warranty covers the following defects, provided that they arise or appear in circumstances in which you have handled, maintained, and used the Product only for its intended purpose and have not subjected it to conditions likely to cause
                        deterioration or damage beyond normal wear:

                    <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages in connection with the sale of consumer products, so the above limitation or exclusion of incidental or consequential damages may not apply
                        to you. This Warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from state to state.</p>

                        to Tuft & Needle at support@tuftandneedle.com. Your failure to comply with these claim submission instructions may void this Warranty. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require photographs, further information or
                        descriptions, or to physically inspect the mattress prior to accepting a particular claim under this Warranty.
